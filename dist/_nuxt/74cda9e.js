Now turn it\n        into a cafe. If only vintage camper build-outs were that simple.\n        Vintage campers—a phrase with a hotly debated definition—aren’t\n        admired solely for their build or design. Instead, they’re tied to a\n        lifestyle that harkens to a mid-century Americana dream of open, dirt\n        roads and obligation-free travels. “From the cars and trailers to the\n        music and culture, they call them the good old days for a reason,”\n        writes the Vintage Camper Trailers Magazine event page. “The thing\n        about the vintage campers—the nostalgia involved in them and the\n        appearance, the look, brings back a lot of memories for people, then\n        it draws them to what you're doing,” says Terry Ziniewicz, founder of\n        Caffewerks, a company that designs parts for and consults with mobile\n        coffee setups. “It inspires people to become customers of that stand\n        because it's got this unique look.”\n      ")]),e._v(" "),o("img",{attrs:{src:n(343),alt:"article image"}}),e._v(" "),o("h5",{staticClass:"sub-head"},[e._v("\n        Extension Note\n      ")]),e._v(" "),o("p",{staticClass:"description"},[e._v("\n        Nostalgia is a powerful marketing tool. Sounds, smells, and visuals\n        from childhood elicit immediate emotions and memories. At one of my\n        first cupping sessions, I was told not to talk about memory-induced\n        flavors. Yes, that coffee might taste like your grandmother’s bone\n        broth but no one else will know what you’re talking about. Psychology\n        research divides nostalgia into two kinds: personal and historical.\n        Personal nostalgia is the kind where you remember how you were and\n        historical is the type that references a time before you were born.\n        While the vintage camper community was kept alive by personal\n        nostalgia, the branching of the campers into retail fronts is\n        maintained by historical nostalgia. As someone who did not grow up\n        hearing about their grandparents’ hippie travels or have any restored\n        furniture inside the home, I am either the best or worst person to\n        write this piece.

Living in San Francisco, there are remnants of this era\n        preserved all over the city. For instance, San Francisco-based Sunset\n        Roasters is in the middle of a vintage camper cafe build-out. “We\n        wanted something that when you looked at it, it immediately would have\n        some story to tell,” says co-founder Sara Roliz. “Something that would\n        come with a history and then we could continue its story was very\n        appealing for us.”\n      ")]),e._v(" "),o("p",{staticClass:"description"},[e._v("\n        NW Mobile Kitchens owner Rich Zeidman, who works on mobile kitchen\n        build-outs from start to finish, says one of the biggest mistakes he\n        sees is business owners not doing enough research on health codes and\n        business planning. He says, “This thing is going to go flying down the\n        road at 60 miles an hour and things have gotta be considered from a\n        safety point of view.” Ziniewicz agrees and adds that under-budgeting\n        is another issue, especially when it’s a DIY project.
