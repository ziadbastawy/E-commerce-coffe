              <p class="description">
                Our shopping pages will guide you through the steps you need to
                take to place an order with us. Our order process allows you to
                check and amend any errors before submitting your order to us.
                Please take the time to read and check your order at each page
                of the order process.
              </p>
              <p class="description">
                After you place an order, you will receive an e-mail from us
                acknowledging that we have received your order. However, please
                note that this does not mean that your order has been accepted.
                Our acceptance of your order will take place as described below.
              </p>
              <p class="description">
                We will confirm our acceptance to you by sending you an e-mail
                that confirms your order has been accepted and has been
                dispatched. Once we send this order acceptance and dispatch
                email, a binding contract will be formed between us (the
                \”Contract\”).

              <p class="description">
                If we are unable to supply you with a Product, for example
                because that Product is not in stock or no longer available or
                because we cannot meet your requested delivery date or because
                of an error in the price on our website as referred to below, we
                will inform you of this by e-mail and we will not process your
                order. If you have already paid for a Product that we are unable
                to supply, we will refund you the full amount including any
                delivery costs charged as soon as possible.

              <p class="description">
                By way of example only, this might be because the Product is out
                of stock, because of unexpected limits on our resources which we
                could not reasonably plan for, because we have identified an
                error in the price or description of the Product or because we
                are unable to meet a delivery deadline you have specified.

                The prices of the Products will be as quoted on our website at

                The price of a Product includes VAT (where applicable) at the
                applicable current rate chargeable in the UK for the time being.
                However, if the rate of VAT changes between the date of your

                It is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of
                the Products we sell may be incorrectly priced. We will normally
                check prices before accepting your order so that, where the
                Product\’s correct price at your order date is less than our
                stated price at your order date, we will charge the lower
                amount. If the Product\’s correct price at your order date is
                higher than the price stated to you, we will contact you for

                obvious and unmistakable and could reasonably have been
                recognized by you as a mispricing, we may end the contract,
                refund you any sums you have paid and require the return of any
